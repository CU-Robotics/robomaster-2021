## cu-robotics/robomaster-2021

#### Description
This repository contains CU Robotics' 2021 Control Code. Due to the coronavirus pandemic, only one robot (Infantry #1) was built for the 2021 season, so everything in this repository is specialized for the Infantry robot only.

Infantry robot capabilities:
- Chassis capable of three axis range of motion enabled by mecanum wheels.
- Turret with 120 degree pitch range of motion.
- Turret capable of continuous 360 degree yaw rotation enabled by a slip ring.
- Gun capable of firing 17mm projectiles at over 30mph.
- FPV camera, giving the operator a realtime first-person view.
- Installation points for the Robomaster referee system, a set of electronics that monitors the robot's virtual health and status.

#### Requirements
To build and upload this code to a Robomaster robot, you will need three things:
1. A Windows machine
2. Keil MDK-Arm IDE: https://www.keil.com/demo/eval/arm.htm
3. An STM32 programmer such as this one: https://www.amazon.com/Aideepen-ST-Link-Programming-Emulator-Downloader/dp/B01J7N3RE6 (Not required to develop & build, only used for robot uploading)

#### Build and Upload Instructions
Under construction :)
